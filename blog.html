								<p> Lately, I realized that I needed a forum to <s>rant</s>... nah, <i>churn</i> out some thoughts and ideas. Perhaps, it would also be good to have a journal 		of the events that happen throughout college - it'd be interesting to look back on my successes, failures, interesting happenings, and what-nots. At this 		point, I'll admit that my writing lacks the eloquence of writers such as Tim O'Brien and Joseph Heller. Even so, I doubt my life would resemble a James 		Bond, or Jason Bourne, action movie. (I like both.) So, excuse my cacophonic writing. Please. </p>

									<p> For the past few days, I've been troubled by two problems. The first lies in academics. It appears that my many attempts to conquer my important classes, namely Math 54 and CS61B, have been futile. In Math 54, I flunked the first midterm. Turns out studying from the past midterms was a mistake - the questions on the actual midterm were more difficult and more comprehensive. To address this, I resolved to writing down the problems on the homework such that reviewing the homework is effortless. So far, it appears to be working, although I did miss a question on the quiz today. I incorrectly made an assumption that a matrix was supposed to be diagonalizable, and, thus, my proof was too narrow. As for CS61B, I'm falling behind - got a lot of catchup to do. </p>

									<p>My second problem lies with my social abilities. Recently, I have been failing to muster the energy to engage in a meaningful conversation. Yesterday, my friend Kenny remarked after observing me with some floormates at Crossroads that I barely spoke a word. Today, I felt invisible as I passed by a floormate without any acknowledgement. I need to figure out how to make a nonacademic conversation, but Kenny warns that I might be too calculated in this approach. I need to experiment, be spontaneous, and take risks. Undoubtedly, this will be one of my biggest challenges in college. </p>

									<p>Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed my honesty in this <i>blog?</i> Is that what you call it? Many have viewed me as an infallible and ultra-smart student. In reality, I feel like I'm being torn to shreds at this point. Maybe writing this will alleviate things. At the very least, I can keep track of my progress. In other news, I'm still playing around with a newly acquired Raspberry Pi and, today, I had an interesting lecture by Professor Schruben in my IEOR seminar. He talked about how operations research was applied during his time in the military during the Vietnam War and also in other companies he worked for. Fascinating. Anyways, I'm putting up some nice images from Reddit on the front page. People are thinking that my placeholder images are bugs. They're not. </p>
