								<p> Today, I missed my morning CS61B discussion and my CS61A OH and Lab to work on my essay for my CWR4B class. Due today was a draft of part of the essay. I ended up spending roughly 5 hours typing a draft, showing how civil disobedience was a concept that developed in the last couple of centuries and has influenced many movements since. I also typed my research proposal, which was an assignment due the week before. Somehow, I didn't see it on the agenda. Anyways, the professor didn't accept my proposal - I didn't list my sources. Turn it next time, she says. </p>
								<p> In the evening, I chose to attend a random CS61B discussion, since I missed my morning discussion. It was rather empty - there was only 10 of us, compared to a rather packed room of about 30 during my regular discussion section. This made things personal and allowed me to ask more questions than I usually would. Maybe I'll start attending this discussion from now on. </p>
								<p> I had dinner with my friend Eric from my high school days. Nothing much went on there. When I returned, I spent about 3 hours typing an essay about my beetle I observed for the Insect Observation project. Over the past months, working on CS has taught me to be as concise as possible. Hence, I found it difficult to meet the 500 word requirement. Or, perhaps, I had typed too much already today. After I finished that, I decided to prepare myself for war with CS61B. That is, I printed out all of the discussion sections practice problems, midterm review problems, one past Hilfinger midterm, and also bought <i> Head First Java </i> from Amazon. I found that when I try to read pdfs,  I always get distracted. $30 is worth it for an A, isn't it? Hopefully. </p>

								<p> After a mere 4 hours of sleep, I woke up to prepare for my insects midterm once more, eating Frosted Flakes while reading websites explaining the anatomy of insects. I ended up doing ok on the midterm. I couldn't get some questions - I guess my studying wasn't thorough enough. </p>
								<p> My lack of sleep caused me to nod on and off during my Math 54 and CS61B lectures today. It feels like the beginning of my restless nights. </p>
								<p> At 6, I went to Kersege to do the Facebook puzzle and met up with Daniel and his friends, Can and Cem, pronounced John and Jem. They're twins from Turkey and are really chill. After spending an hour reviewing our Python knowledge, we attempted the puzzle. For the first 10 minutes, I was extremely productive. But, when I didn't get the right answer, I kinda froze up and lost faith in my approach. So, I watched Daniel attempt the puzzle. 20 minutes later, I realized that I was super duper close - all I had to do was to sort the list of binary digits. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to sort the sequence in the remaining time. It was quite a letdown, realizing that I were so close but got sidetracked. </p>
								<p> After a quick and late dinner at Crossroads with the trio, I headed to Unit 1 to help Jessica with the next CS61A lab. I was surprised that many of the problems I struggled to do in CS61A came naturally to me when I attempted them. We ended up completing the entire lab - it took us about 3 hours. But yea, now, I have to write my essays for CWR4B. Ugh.. </p>

								<p> Yesterday was pretty uneventful. I did my math hw for the next lecture during the afternoon. </p>
								<p> At 5pm, Kenny invited me to go lifting with him. It felt weird to be in there and not know what to do. He showed me how to do squats, deadlifts, benchpress, army lifts? with barbells, curls, and much more. I couldn't get the form correct for many of the exercises. Maybe after a couple more rounds I'll start getting it right. </p>
								<p> My evening wasn't that exciting. I spent my wee hours of the night studying for my insects test. Andrew's friend Steve also came to visit while I was studying. He was particularly loud and annoying, blasting kpop music. </p>

								<p>Today, I woke up close to 12pm, which is sorta atypical of me. Perhaps, it's because of the absence of my roommate. Over lunch at Thai Noodle with my RA Patrick, I developed a theory that my roommate Andrew exerts a bad influence on me in a positive way. My logic was this: his sleeping at 4am, random sleeping habits, and his major LOL playing epitomizes the actions I need to do the opposite of. Therefore, when he's around, I sleep earlier, wake up earlier, eat reguarly, etc. I think that's how it works. </p>
								<p>After Thai Noodle, which, btw, was delicious, I attended my Pioneers in Engineering meeting, in which I just installed Visual Studio and Unity on my VM. Nothing special there. After I arrived back in my dorm, I elected to do my laundrry and chores, wiping the table tops, cleaning out the fridge, the shelves, windows, and sorting my papers. I really didn't feel like doing my CS61B hw at this point. I also got started on setting up a Web Server on my Raspberry Pi, but, as of this writing, I'm not very far into it. I did muster the motivation to do my CS61B hw after dinner at Crossroads with fellow floormates, though. It took several hours and was about Java's Regular Expressions, which are a pain. Anyways, I'm developing a better grasp of regex now. </p>
								<p>Shortly after I finished, I heard the girls next to my room scream. 5 minutes later, Matt taps on my door, which I opened and saw my RA Patrick handling this massive bug. He stuck it into a water bottle and gave it to me. Why? I have an Insect Observation Project due Wednesday for my Insects and Human Society class. So, I gathered my laptop and other electronics and moved into the laundry room to do my observation. No way was I going to keep this big fat bug in my room! </p>
								<p> My field notes for the bug were pretty terrible and so were my drawings. But, about an hour later, Brandon joins me in the laundry room and we started talking about our high school relationships. Three other people, Matt, Eric, and Patrick, also joined in and we continued this conversation in Matt's room and later my room until 4am in the morning. </p>
								<p> That evening, Roger told me that he met my amazing friend Natalie at an orchestra concert. I haven't talked to Natalie in a while, she seemed super busy with all the things that were going on. Harvard, ya know. She was surprised to learn that I now had a website. Hopefully you're seeing this! Anyways, she made me miss her and all my friends who were far far away. I hope to talk to them soon. =D </p>

								<p> Of all the weekdays, at least for this semester, Friday is my favorite. Since my classes start at 12pm on Fridays, I'm able to sleep in, not attend a class about insects, not take a math quiz, and eat a nice unhurried lunch at Crossroads. Some of my peers won't agree with my last statement, but I'll say, <i> today's catfish was gooood. </i> </p>
								<p> Math lecture today was taught by another GSI. I learned today that Professor Graunbaum missed the past week because of a leg injury. For this lecture, the GSI introduced pretty cool real world applications of linear algebra. But, after that, I kinda zoned out - I couldn't really understand his writing or his lecturing. Instead, I continued to finish the math hw for the current section, continuing on my plan to be a day ahead of lecture instead of playing catch-up each time. It really helps - before going to discussion, I already have a basic understanding of the section and, thus, the discussion reinforces the knowledge I gained from reading ahead. </p>
								<p> By far, the most interesting part of my day was visiting an EECS lab with my friend Daniel Pok. He introduced me to a graduate student, Victor, who led us into his lab. In the lab, a behemouth $100k full motion driving simulator stood in the center, along with other humanoid robots off to the side. Victor explained that the simulator is going to be used for observing how people perform under duress, drunkeness, etc. For now, though, he says that they installed <i> Need for Speed </i> on the simulator. I watched Daniel use the simulator first and, from my vantage point, every time he crashed, the simulator jerked up and down and side to side. After another person used the simulator, I got to play! Compared to the previous drivers, I chose to drive more cautiously around curves. It felt extremely smooth when around banks the chair rotated around the center. And, surprisingly, when I crashed, the jerk, yaw, and rotation wasn't as sharp as it looked from the outside. When my car finally came to a halt, due to the extensive damage to my car, I was on my second lap, the only one in the group to do so. =D It was definitely an epic ending to a long long week! K. I'm exhausted.</p>

								<p> So, Jessica was right. I ended arriving to my CS61B lab 20 minutes late. So much for a 10am! </p>
								<p> Yet, despite my inability to finish the CS61B lab during the session - oh, and the fact that I forgot to do my CWR4B hw - I feel much better than yesterday. Perhaps, it was the Korean restaurant in the Northside Asian Ghetto that I ate at for the first time -- definitely coming back. More likely though, it was because I heeded all the Reddit advice Kenny sent me yesterday. In particular, I realized that I needed more confidence... not arrogance, but <i>confidence</i>. </p>
								<p> I discovered today that finding a book in a huge library is extremely complicated. After obtaining the address of the book, <i>Iranian Hostage: A Personal Diary of 444 Days in Captivity </i>, (it was the subject I chose for the social change research project!), which was E183.8I55S54 1984, I had to locate section E, which I found out after making a round around the library was on Floor C. After that and another round around the library this time on Floor C, I located section E. Shelf I55 was deep within section E and, actually, was quite hard to find. The story gets worse: the books on the bookshelf aren't really organized well -- S54 doesn't really give you anything. I wounded up just choosing a random part of the long bookshelf.. and <i> viola</i> my book was there. I also picked up other books.. but yea.. long story.</p>
								<p>I also had an Enactus meeting today. I had never really intended to join the club. On the day of their first meeting, I was looking for a different club, Berkeley Consulting Club. They were having a meeting in 106 Moffit and I saw two girls, Cassie and Alicia, in suits exiting from a nearby classroom. Being 30 minutes late, I assumed that they were from the Berkeley Consulting Club. After asking if <i>the meeting</i> was over - they said, "yes" - I asked to put myself on the mailing list. Turns out, they were exiting from 103 Moffit, not 106 Moffit. But, nevertheless, I applied to Enactus, passed the interview, and now I'm in the club. I think it's a promising organization.</p>
								<p>Anyways... that's enough for today. Confidence! C'mon Brian! </p>

								<p> Lately, I realized that I needed a forum to <s>rant</s>... nah, <i>churn</i> out some thoughts and ideas. Perhaps, it would also be good to have a journal 		of the events that happen throughout college - it'd be interesting to look back on my successes, failures, interesting happenings, and what-nots. At this 		point, I'll admit that my writing lacks the eloquence of writers such as Tim O'Brien and Joseph Heller. Even so, I doubt my life would resemble a James 		Bond, or Jason Bourne, action movie. (I like both.) So, excuse my cacophonic writing. Please. </p>

									<p> For the past few days, I've been troubled by two problems. The first lies in academics. It appears that my many attempts to conquer my important classes, namely Math 54 and CS61B, have been futile. In Math 54, I flunked the first midterm. Turns out studying from the past midterms was a mistake - the questions on the actual midterm were more difficult and more comprehensive. To address this, I resolved to writing down the problems on the homework such that reviewing the homework is effortless. So far, it appears to be working, although I did miss a question on the quiz today. I incorrectly made an assumption that a matrix was supposed to be diagonalizable, and, thus, my proof was too narrow. As for CS61B, I'm falling behind - got a lot of catchup to do. </p>

									<p>My second problem lies with my social abilities. Recently, I have been failing to muster the energy to engage in a meaningful conversation. Yesterday, my friend Kenny remarked after observing me with some floormates at Crossroads that I barely spoke a word. Today, I felt invisible as I passed by a floormate without any acknowledgement. I need to figure out how to make a nonacademic conversation, but Kenny warns that I might be too calculated in this approach. I need to experiment, be spontaneous, and take risks. Undoubtedly, this will be one of my biggest challenges in college. </p>

									<p>Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed my honesty in this <i>blog?</i> Is that what you call it? Many have viewed me as an infallible and ultra-smart student. In reality, I feel like I'm being torn to shreds at this point. Maybe writing this will alleviate things. At the very least, I can keep track of my progress. In other news, I'm still playing around with a newly acquired Raspberry Pi and, today, I had an interesting lecture by Professor Schruben in my IEOR seminar. He talked about how operations research was applied during his time in the military during the Vietnam War and also in other companies he worked for. Fascinating. Anyways, I'm putting up some nice images from Reddit on the front page. People are thinking that my placeholder images are bugs. They're not. </p>
